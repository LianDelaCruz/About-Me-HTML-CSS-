                <strong>As we all experience our ups and downs, it is a challenge to feel inspired everyday. But whenever I feel that way, I stop and start to think of things and people that inspire me. My family back in my home country is definitely one of my inspiration and motivation to go and make myself better and at the same time enjoy life. My partner and our dog inspires me to be a better person, to be kind to one another, and especially to animals. Being inspired by them makes me feel more motivated to help other people, animals and our environment. Like they always say, <q>If they can do it, then I can definitely do it!</q>
