            Hi! I am Lian, 29 years old and I came from The Philippines. Moving to Sweden was a bit of a challenge, but to live here and survive all by myself is I think the most challenging and exciting part of my journey. The language, the culture, and how we live here is very different from what I grew up with. Sweden has thought me how to be independent and how to embrace whatever the world is throwing at me. And here I am, stronger than ever!

            When my partner can't find his phone even though it is in front of him, I tell him this: <strong><q><i>If it's a snake, it already bit you. hehe</i></q></strong>
